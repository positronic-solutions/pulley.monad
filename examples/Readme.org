* Introduction
  This directory contains examples that illustrate various aspects
  of =pulley.monad=.
* Extracting the Source Code
  As with the rest of =pulley.monad=,
  these examples are written in a literate style.
  You can extract the code for each example
  using the Emacs function =org-babel-tangle=.
  By default, this function is bound to =C-c C-v C-t=.
  The code for each example is independent â€”
  you only need to extract code each example you want to work with.
* Working with Examples
  Once you have extracted the code, you can add the example code
  to the classpath using the =examples= Leiningen profile.
  For example, most of the examples contain a few tests
  to help ensure the example functions correctly.
  You can run these tests via the following command:

  #+begin_src bash
    lein with-profile examples test
  #+end_src

  Note that to start a REPL, you will have to add the =default= profile as well:

  #+begin_src bash
    lein with-profile examples,default repl
  #+end_src
